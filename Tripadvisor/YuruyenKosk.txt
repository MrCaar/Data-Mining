Yorum Basligi: A delightful little attraction in a beautiful spot
Yorum: Yürüyen Köşk, “Walking Pavilion”, is a large beach hut really. It was previously owned by Atatürk, and has now been restored as a museum.The story is that in 1929 Atatürk went ashore to sit under the ancient (600 year old) plane tree there. He liked it and asked for a small house to be built. The wooden construction was completed in 22 days. A year later he returned to find a gardener about to cut the branches of the great plane tree because they were resting on the roof of the house. Atatürk famously ordered “The branch must not be cut, the house must be moved!” The house was moved in two days after putting tram tracks under it. Thus Atatürk saved both the tree and the house. Thus, the house gained the nickname “Walking Pavilion”. It is a delightful place to visit but there is no public transport nearby except for a little electric bus that only runs about once an hour until 4pm. There is however a well paved walkway and cycle path from the Yalova pier where the ferry from Pendik comes in. I was on a day trip from Istanbul. Bikes can be hired in Yalova town centre. It is about a 20 minute walk and there are a sandy beach, a picnic spot and a small cafe on the way, so make a day of it! Entry to the grounds is free. Tours of the pavilion are given in Turkish every 30 minutes during the week and every 20 minutes at the weekend. The tour lasts about 10 minutes as it's a very small house! Buy your ticket in advance from the cafe for 4 TL. Definitely recommended.

Yorum Basligi: Green environment
Yorum: The operation of the pavilion was done in two processes. On August 8, the general day terrace section, in the remaining two, was purchased on the main tracks and the building was shifted to the east in the 5 meter process. The production mansion was saved from being demolished and the plane tree from being cut down. Thank you Ataturk.

Yorum Basligi: An Environmentalist Approach in 20th Century in Turkey
Yorum: If you visit to Yalova (A city located in the Marmara Region, vis a vis to Istanbul, I recommend to see the summer house of Ataturk (in Turkish: Ataturk Yalova Kosku). As a building, you may not see anything special. However, the history of the villa house is remarkable in terms of environmental friendly approach of a politician. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who is the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, provided a guidance how to save an old tree by organizing a system to move his villa house. I strongly agree to Ataturk that the woods of Yalova should be conserved sensitively.

Yorum Basligi: Peace is in the air
Yorum: This is a very little manor. But definitely worth seeing. You will find a tour guide to tell you the place. It has a beautiful history and i must say one of the most peaceful places I have ever been. Tahmin ettiğimden daha küçük ama çok kadar da zevkliydi. 15 dk lik rehberli tur kesinlikle yeterli ve güzel düşünülmüş. Huzur dolu bir yer.

Yorum Basligi: A thought-provoking slice of Turkish history
Yorum: Beautiful, eccentric, thought-provoking, windswept, mind-boggling, tranquil, the Yürüyen Kösk is all of these and many more. For an insight into the mind of a truly great man, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the story of the sycamore tree and why this house truly did "walk", and the contemporary articles inside all make this a must-see if you visit Yalova or the surrounding area.

Yorum Basligi: Koskun Management Failure to Complete the Deficiencies!
Yorum: My tour guide was a very kind and respectful lady. They have guided us twice. The exterior of the mansion, rather than the interior, has been run very poorly and carelessly for years. The port part has not been repaired for years. The restaurant is not hygienic and the staff never smiles. The tiny vehicles that operate the free IDO tour are dirty and rusty. Your coat sinks inside every time. Why the municipality and ministry officials do not read these comments and do not take precautions is a separate issue..
