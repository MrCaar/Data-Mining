Yorum Basligi: Mosque of Mehmed I
Yorum: In my opinion - and I know lots of people will disagree - mosques in general are more picturesque and exciting from the outside ; often they are a fairly plain open space inside, sparsely decorated.The Mosque of Mehmed I is an exception : outside 2 elegant minarets and iwan with elaborate muqarnas, inside a white marble fountain with a pool beneath the central dome and sensational turquoise mihrab niche. Chandelier, dome, colored glass windows, calligraphy . . . it really is a masterpiece.

Yorum Basligi: Two Green Mosque in Bursa area
Yorum: The first picture on this side is of the Green Mosque (Yesil Camii) finished in 1391-92 in iznik Golu (suburb of Bursa approximately 76 km from Bursa)- the minaret is of beautiful greens and blues tiles. But the rest of the photographs on this sight are of the Green Mosque completed in 1422 in Bursa which has beautiful green blue tiles inside.  The drive to iZNIK was worth the time - the agricultural is stunning and helps you understand why there’s fresh produce all over Turkey- take a drive and enjoy Iznik

Yorum: This beautiful mosque is known as the green mosque due to the wonderful tiles. Though this is not a large one and there are better examples of tiles in Istanbul in the Blue Mosque for example, the building and artist expression in the tiles is worth the visit.  Further up from the mosque is the tomb of Mehmed the 1st.  This too has exquisite tiles.

Yorum Basligi: A beautiful mosque in Bursa, built in 1421.
Yorum: Obviously opinions are subjective, but I think this is the most beautiful mosque in Bursa. The mosque sits near the Green Tomb, on a height overlooking the city. The tiles look more blue than green, but are tastefully and beautifully done, and the mosque is a peaceful place. It can be visited by tourists, although of course respectful behaviour must be observed. It was built by Mehmed I, who re-established Ottoman rule after the defeat of the previous Sultan by Tamerlane.

Yorum Basligi: A peaceful mosque with stunning tile work
Yorum: The Green Mosque (a.k.a. Yeşil Camii, or Mosque of Mehmed I) is beautifully set in a small park among cypress trees at the top of a hill.  It was built in 1422 by Mehmed's son and successor Murad II and designed by architect, Hacı Ivaz Pasha.  Green mosque is a part of a larger complex (külliye) with a türbe (mausoleum), madrasah (school), kitchen and bath.  The mosque is a square building clad in marble and topped by two large domes, with two brick minarets at the rear corners.  A half-dome with intricate muqarnas (ornamental vaulting) is above the entry door.  The name Green Mosque comes from the dark green and blue tiles covering the lower interior sandstone walls.  The interior is softly lit by windows, with an oculus above an ornate ablution basin in the central hall.  The octagonal prayer hall is flanked by recessed mahfils (raised platforms).  The mihrab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca) is particularly fine, with an intricate tile frame, an interior of geometric tiles in blue, purple, white, and yellow. and surmounted by carved muqarnas.  The original mosque was renewed after the 1855 earthquake, again in 1941, and recently in 2010-2012.  The mosque is beautifully lit at night.  The Green Tomb,  the mausoleum of the fifth Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I  (died in 1421) is nearby.  The mosque is open daily with no entry fee, although a donation is appreciated.  It is an active mosque for both men and women, so may be closed during prayers.   As a sign of respect, when visiting, modest clothing should be worn and shoes removed before entering.

He was nice enough to talk about the architecture of the mosque and its historical importance... finally he presented a chaplet for supplications after he raised the Athan . A marvelous voice.!!!

Other notable features include the mosque raised higher than the rest to separate it from the government offices where judges and others worked and marble fountain. Worth 20 minutes of your time if you are in Bursa. From here it's a nice 25 minute walk to the Grand Mosque (which if you only have time for one, see that).P.S. The guy who says he is the artist is likely just getting you to come to his store after a really nice tour. Great guy and puts no pressure on you (except social) to buy something...and his website does not seem to be real (along with this Genova, Italy store).

This place had a closeness which you miss in the larger Mosques, grand architecture is great but sometimes you can feel the smaller places better.

Yorum Basligi: A wise Monarch
Yorum: This is a Mosque that was built adjacent to the Sultan's Office. The Sultan used to meet with his Ministers in some quarters the visitor can see when he enters the Mosque, on his right . I was accompanied by my wife when I visited Bursa in December 2014. The history of the Mosque was briefly narrated to us by an eminent Turkish Historian who is also the custodian of the Mosque. If you happen to visit this beautiful place, it is worth listening to this man's telling of some stories related to the golden age of Bursa that was the First ever Capital of Turkey under the Suleyman's reign.

Yorum: The Green Mosque is nice with its two fountains (one outside the entrance for ablution and one just in the middle of the prayer zone). Just opposite the Mosque there is the Mausoleum of the local sultan. The square is animated with people going up and down for prayer and there are also nice old women trying to convince turists to buy spinning tops.

Yorum Basligi: Fantastic Mosque but...
Yorum: A fantastic mosque with stunning tiles and much better than the larger ones in Istanbul.Beware as there is a man inside the Mosque who appears to target western visitors and tells an impressive story of how he is restoring the tiles of the Mosque and has been retained by some of the world’s top museums for restoration work.  He then invites you to his "studio" which surprisingly for someone with such a background is in fact a tourist shop nearby selling tiles and silks.  He then offers you tiles which he says he hand painted.   Although not experts, these tiles appeared to us to be machine made and worth far less than he was selling for.   Unless sure that you are really getting a bargain, it is perhaps worth giving this a miss.

Yorum Basligi: The most interesting mosque in Bursa
Yorum: If you only see one thing in Bursa, see this mosque, along with the Green Tomb nearby. (The Turkish and Islamic Art Museum is also close by, and can be worth a short detour if you have time to spare. It is housed in a historic medrese that was part of the mosque complex.)Although not as enormous as the Ulu Cami (Great Mosque), the Green Mosque is arguably more impressive and more interesting. The exterior is incomplete because the facade is normally preceded by a columned portico which was apparently never added here, but that just makes it all the more unique. The windows all around the front and the sides are also beautifully framed.The interior is grand and features plenty of details worth exploring, and is of course heavily tiled in the early Ottoman style. The tiled mihrab is tall and majestic and worth examining up close. Don't forget to explore the curious side chambers on either side of the main hall.

The main prayer hall has a marble fountain of drinkink water. The prayer hall is linked with other small prayers halls giving it a look of Mughal architect. The upkeep of the mosque and surrounding area is excellent. We also met the moazzin, imam and mudür of the mosque, who welcomed us with a big smile. Its an excellent mosque with quite a different layout and architect.

Yorum: The Green Mosque is very understated and, best of all, there are hardly any people.  Also notice the decorative stonework on the exterior. It is really Yeşil Türbe (tombs) that blew us away and is the must-see.  The tiles inside are really turquoise except for the gorgeous emerald green tiles around the doorway.

Yorum Basligi: Beautiful mosque
Yorum: In a recent month-long journey through Turkey I saw many mosques - big and small, old and new - and the Yesil Cami would certainly rank with the best of them. The most beautiful mirhab is apparently known as the 'gate to paradise' and is indeed beautiful.  The building certainly has a most interesting history not originally being built as a mosque and underwent, apparently, a complete restoration three or four years ago. I first visited the mosque on Sunday when it was very busy with many local tourists (I had a lovely talk with some very pleasant young ladies from Batman) and returned at about 9am the next morning when I had the whole mosque to myself, apart from two men at prayer, which was quite something. I was approached by a gentleman named Yusuf who, so he told me, was involved in the restoration of the mosque and was most interesting to talk to - it then transpired that he had a nearly shop to which he invited me for tea........ As other people have said, the nearby museum is well worth a visit and is set in a beautiful old building which I believe was a 15th century madrasah. When in Bursa it is also worth visiting the Bursa Kent (City) Museum in Ataturk Avenue in the square behind the statue of Ataturk astride a horse - interesting exhibits but unfortunately little English

The whole site can easily be reached on foot from the Bursa centre in around 15 mins.

Constructed by Ivaz Pasa, the mosque's delicate workmanship is visibly unfinished in certain areas both outside and inside of the Mosque. No reason can be traced to this astonishing aspect. When compared with other impressive monuments of the city, Green Mosque is less grandiose but it definitely deserves a highly praised place in early Ottoman architectural style.

Yorum: Combined with the Turbe, i.e. the mausoleum, of the same name (Yesil = green), this mosque is one of the most notable attractions of the city, second only to the Muradiye complex, located in another district of Bursa. If you manage to visit it in one of the rare moments in which it is not crowded with large groups of visitors of various nationalities accompanied by chatty guides, beyond the beauty of the walls covered with ceramic tiles, it also gives a sense of spirituality. Which, these days, doesn't hurt.
