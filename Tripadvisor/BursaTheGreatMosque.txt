Yorum: The grand mosque is just outside the Koza Han (bazaar) near what looked like a main square. It's free to walk in for all (except during prayer times I would think) - a good experience to go in and gave a look. They provide head scarves and skirts for any visitors who are not dressed appropriately.

One side you can see real black cover from Kabe, and bunch of others. You will feel that you go back to centuries back. Love this place. One of must go places in my list...

Yorum Basligi: The Grand Mosque of Bursa, created to celebrate a victory over the crusaders at Nicopolis.
Yorum: The mosque was built by Bayezid I to celebrate the important victory over the crusader forces at Nicopolis. The mosque dates back to 1399, however it was possibly burned shortly after by Tamerlane, and it was heavily damaged in the 1800’s by a large earthquake. It was mostly reconstructed at that time, so the interior feels newer than some of the other mosques in Turkey.

Yorum Basligi: There is a wonderful feeling of seeing the Great Mosque.
Yorum: The 20 domes and the awesome calligraphy on the walls, the perfect feeling to take ablution with the ice-cold water of Uludağ in the fountain inside the mosque, are among the mosque tombs that must be visited to experience a different feeling in the ancestral hearth.According to a rumor, the story of a man who heard the saying that if you pray here five times a day, you will definitely meet a guardian, praying with a congregation of only parents is worth investigating.What surprised me the most was not its twenty domes or the enormous calligraphy on each wall. The fountain, which is located in the courtyard of every mosque, is located in the masjid here, and even though the water is ice cold, no one complains about making ablution there and it tastes good.

Yorum Basligi: Large central mosque with beautiful and peaceful interior
Yorum: The Great Mosque (a.k.a. Ulu Cami) is on the main street (where  the Atatürk Cd. becomes Cemal Nadir Cd.) and is the largest mosque in Bursa, showcasing Seljuk-style architecture. Many consider it the fifth most important mosque in Islam (after those in Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Damascus), and is included in Bursa’s 2014 UNESCO World Heritage Site description.  The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Bayezid I, and designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1399. The large square building has twenty domes arranged in four rows of five, supported by twelve columns. According to legend,  twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which the Sultan had promised after winning the Battle of Nicopolis over an allied crusader army in 1396. The mosque's two cylindrical minarets are prominent landmarks if you wander around central Bursa.  The interior of the mosque is spacious, filled with light, and has graceful calligraphy and floral motifs adorning the walls and columns.  At the center is a şadırvan (fountain) where worshipers can perform ritual ablutions before prayer.  The dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which highlights the fountain's softly cascading water.  The mihrab (prayer niche oriented towards Mecca) is particularly fine, bordered by intricate decorative tiles and  bands of graceful calligraphy.  Throughout the interior are graceful inscriptions on the walls and columns written by famous Ottoman calligraphers of the period, one of the finest examples of Islamic calligraphy in the world. The interior is shielded from street noise and invites contemplation, encouraged by a reader softly reciting passages from the Koran.  The mosque is open during normal hours with no entrance fee (although a donation is gratefully appreciated).  Modest attire and removing one's shoes shows respect for this active place of worship.

Yorum Basligi: Early example of Ottoman mosques
Yorum: Since Bursa was the first capital of Ottoman empire, this mosque is one of the earliest examples of grand mosques. There are 20 small domes instead of a big one since it was impossible in that period. For architecture buffs, you need to follow the success of Ottoman architecture in the 2nd capital Edirne and then finish in the last capital Istanbul.

Yorum Basligi: Stunning!
Yorum: The Grand Mosque of Bursa is an Islamic masterclass in architecture, beauty and refinement. The mosque was finished in 1399 and is truly eye opening and a sight to behold.   In the centre of the mosque (inside the mosque) there is a fountain where water pours from and Wudu can be performed.Wudu can also be done outside the mosque, however, it seemed nice to be able to perform ablution in the prayer hall itself.The mosque is busy and it might pay to attend early if you are going to pray.

It's a great mosque, with 20 domes, but you can't see these 20 domes from anyplace nearby. Moreover, no English signs for tourists.Anyway, I recommend to have a toast sandwich with Turkish Tea (Cay) from the place in front of it (nearby the fountain)

Yorum: If you have visited Blue mosque or Sulemaniye camii you would have found them similar in structure. I can assure this Camii worth to visit as it is way different from those and quite interesting and different structure which make it unique. It has very magnificent calligraphic writing and art work  on walls/ If you are into calligraphy then you should visit this place and highly recommend it. Its an active Mosque, you can pray if you are Muslim.This place is near to all other historical attraction in Bursa. Once you reach that area, all hiistorical places can be covered by foot except for Inkaya tarihi cinar

Yorum Basligi: Multi-Domed Early Ottoman Mosque
Yorum: After the Turks conquered Byzantium (now Istanbul), they learned the art of building huge soaring domes from Hagia Sofia. This early Ottoman mosque was built in 1399, before the conquest of Byzantium in 1453, so it uses a radically different design. Rather than one huge dime, it has many small ones. This means the interior is cluttered with numerous support columns. This makes it seem less open and airy. The solemn stone walls and columns do have their own austere beauty however and some sections are decorated with paintings, which softens the overall effect. There is also a cooling fountain inside the mosque.The Ulu Mosque is very centrally located so huge crowds of pious locals pour in here all day. This is not a museum but a living mosque, so non-Muslims can visit but need to be sensitive and discreet. There will be many people praying during your visit.

Yorum: Ulucami is the last mosque built in the form of a "grand mosque" in Turkish Seljuk architecture. There are 20 domes (4*5) and 2 minarets. There is a fountain (şadırvan) under the middle dome which is unique for the mosques. You will be amazed by the caligraphy on the walls and columns, it is actually considered as the biggest calligraphy museum of the world since you can find some of the best and largest works of Ottoman calligraphy in the mosque. The "minber" of the mosque is considered as one of the finest pieces of Turkish wood carving art, you can see the solar system if you look closely, the biggest semisphere symbolises the sun and you can see the other planets around while the background is formed in the shape of Turkish stars. I am sure you will enjoy this great mosque and its surroundings.

We felt welcome and able to look around. It is well worth a visit but do see the Green Mosque afterwards as that is the highlight of Bursa.Count the domes - there is a story that the conqueror of Bursa had promised to build 20 mosques if he captured the city but that an advisor suggested he could fulfill his vow through a mosque with 20 domes.

Yorum Basligi: Best at Fajr Prayers
Yorum: Ulu Camii is best understood by Fajr Prayers. You should arrive early and attend to the prayer in the small section allocated for prayers behind the mihrab. You should definitely read a guide before visiting. If you cannot find a proper one, i suggest Bursa Ulu Cami Rehberi prepared by Mustafa Guleryuz. There are many important things to see in the mosque. However i think the most interesting one is Minber which proves the world as round by some 230 years before Galileo. In summary you should spend time to explore and best is to attend a tour with a licensed guide. This is a world heritage place, does not matter whether Unesco recognizes or not. You would like to go there again and again.

I have heard a legend about Ulu Camii mosque states that before an earthquake happened in Bursa in 1999 the souls of all previous Rulers (padishah) of the Ottoman period raised and prayed, and the security of the Mosque were the evidents of that...Entering the Mosque you feel peace of mind and wonder. At the enter a kerchief for women is provided. I recommend to visit this place notwithstand of your age, religion, nationality...

This mosque is said to be the fifth most important in the Islamic world having been built in the 1390s.  One of the many items on display is a carpet dating back to 1517.  The history is fascinating but it was the warmth of the people that impressed me the most.  There were no tourist there when we visited (Friday at 11 a.m.).  Highly recommended

Yorum Basligi: The kindness extended to us is typical of Islam
Yorum: It was pouring with rain,my shoes were saturated and the rest of me wasn't faring much better but I doggedly pushed on. It was prayer time when visitors are not allowed in Mosques. Fair enough. After some wheedling by our guide the sentries at the door took pity on the pathetic dripping wet petitioners and allowed us 5 minutes. It was rather special being in a mosque at prayer time. The men and women worshipped together but not sideby side. Thank-you for your kindness.

Yorum Basligi: Number 1 must visit in Bursa!
Yorum: Bursa is naturally very beautiful especially with the Uludag (the great big mountain).  Bursa is also the hometown of Turkish silk, iskender kebap and car manufacturing.  But what is more important is that Bursa is the first capital of the Ottoman empire and at the center of it is the Ulu cami or the Grand Mosque ..... a marvelous piece of history.  Unlike any other mosque in the world, it is significant for having all these amazing calligraphic pieces of Art .... nothing like this in the world.After visiting the mosque, one can go and walk and shop around in the historical bazaar .. then end his or her trip with a nice meal of Iskender Kebap.

Yorum Basligi: The 5th Holy Mosque of  Muslim World
Yorum: Ulu cami, the Grand Mosque in Bursa, is one of the oldest & holiest  worship center of Turkey which was built in  between 1396-1399 by Bayezid I during the enlargement of Ottoman state. According to  one of the folk legends, Ottoman sultan Bayezid I  prayed for  Allah and promised Him  that Sultan would  build 20 mosques if he was the winner of battle of Nicopolis against to Crusaders in 1396. After the victory, he wanted to build 20 mosques first as he promised but Emir sultan, the great sufi of its time and son-in-law of the sultan, recommended him to build a grand mosque with three gates and 20 domes so Ulu cami was built for this advice. It contains 3 gates, 20 domes, 2 minarets and a fountain in the middle for ablution. The mosque has an excellent apperance, architectural form and location in down downt to reach easily. As soon as someone enters  the mosque from a gate, he/she come across with a holy atmosphere which makes a great  impact as having peace and glory. The eyes catches the calligraphic wall inscriptions in Arabic making a mystic shade and cannot stop looking at the beauties. The mosque has 193 calligraphic wall decorartions written  41 famous calligraphers in 14 different handwritten forms. The inner part of the mosque covers an area of 2215 square meters divided into five main sections. The fountain in the middele of the inner court is the fisr foundation  build in the state and it has been serving to the prayers to clean  their bodies before they devote them to Allah.  Ulu cami is consiredered the 5th holy mosque in Islamic world after Mesjidi-Haram in Mecca, Mesjidi Nabavi in Medina- Mesjidi Aksa in Jaruseelam and Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Emil Sultan offered to sultan to be built,  Somuncu baba was the first imam and the first calling prayer inviting the people was Suleiman Chalabi. It is believed that Hazrat Khidr-ghost prophet-  has a spirutal office on the right side of   vav calligraphy next to the altar. It is " must " to visit in Bursa trip and I hope no one will  miss this holy place.

The city respects its history and is one of the most important ottoman's place to understand the empire and its importance. Ulu Mosque is unique, the fountain right in the middle makes it a surprise. I really like mosques because they are very peaceful places, but this mosque seems even more special, the lighting and the fountain gives you the feeling that you are outside, very interesting. Being beside the bazaars it is very refreshing to enter and have some peace while all is so busy outside.

Yorum: This is the must-see attraction in Bursa. Having already visited mosques in Istanbul, I was expecting this to be similar, but I was cetainly wrong. There was a fountain for ablutions in the middle of the mosque, and the light shone on it from the domed roof above. You had to look closely to see that above the fountain there was actually a hole in the roof. No part of the moque floor was closed to tourists, so you had to be careful to respect those who were praying, but the whole mosque seemed to have a more laid back atmosphere, with children running about, for example. I really enjoyed the vibe and we were able to sit in the mosque and watch what was going on.

The mosque is unique in that the center has a fountain for ablutions. The story I was told that when the Sultan undertook to build the camii, he had to buy up land from the owners on whose land the building was to sit.  One lady, a non-Muslim, did not want to sell, but finally agreed if her land was not to be used for religious purposes. Hence, the fountain,which much adds to the beauty and majesty of the building.  Lots of wonder Arabic calligraphy and beautiful woodwork.  Well worth a visit.

Yorum Basligi: The Great Mosque..The Great Architecture..
Yorum: When you visit Bursa, Turkey, you must visit this mosque. This mosque is the biggest one in Bursa and a landmark of early Ottoman architecture. this mosque was designed and build by architect Ali Neccar in 1396-1399. It is a rectangular building with twenty domes arranged in four rows of five that are supported by twelve columns. I love to see the fountain inside/in the middle of this mosque. This fountain for worshipers so they can perform ritual ablutions before prayer (taking wudhu before prayer). The dome over the fountain is capped by a skylight which creates a soft light below. Its really beautiful here. The interior of the mosque is amazing with a lot of beautiful Quran calligraphy. There're are many shops, restaurants surrounding this mosque. This mosque is also close to Bursa Bazaar/Market too. Put your shoes in to plastic bag that provided in the entrance of the mosque (free) before entering this mosque. Remain quite inside because this mosque is an active mosque and many people are praying here during the praying time.

Yorum: 'The Ulu Camii'= The Great Mosque is a must visit when you spend a few days in Turkey. The beautiful architecture, mind blowing callegraphy all around the mosque's walls, and the beautiful small water fountain in the center (originally created for Muslims' ablution before praying) give the place a great atmosphere and brings a sense of deep imitation. As a sign of respect to this sacred place, non-Muslim women must were decent clothing which includes long dress or pants and a scarf (both are provided at the entrance if you forgot yours). I personally visited the Ulu camii twice but still longing for another visit :)

Yorum Basligi: A truly great mosque
Yorum: This beautiful huge mosque ranks, naturally, up with the other great ones that I have seen in Turkey.  I was most impressed with the huge calligraphic works on the walls - I had only seen this once before, in the Eski Camii (Old Mosque) in Erdine. This huge space is well lit by the windows in the dome and, all in all, is a very gracious building. There is also a large .... (name ?) ablution pool inside the mosque which I don't think that I had seen before in any other mosque (Yesil Camii has a very small decorative fountain inside).  On the day I visited there were many people there obviously from many parts of Turkey and many other countries, it was not too crowded as the mosque is of a huge scale and can easily accommodate so many people.  I enjoyed being there with so many people.

Yorum Basligi: Ulu Camii (Great Mosque), Bursa
Yorum: The Ulu Camii, an early Ottaman architecture (1396-1399), having may domes supported by two columns, with a fountain inside the mosque for ablution capped by a skylight, provides a peaceful and contemplative setting for prayer and meditation. Its distinctive monumental inscriptions are the greatest example of Islamic calligraphy, the very first thing you notice as you enter the mosque. I remember a friend of ours (Eloisa) from the Far East noticed immediately how beautiful the calligraphy was. The central fountain is very noticeable.The location of the Mosque in the center of Bursa, close to entrances of the covered bazar and the Koza Hani (Silk Bazar), draws lots of worshippers from among the shop-owners who just cover their displayed goods with a sheet of cloth and leaving their shops unlocked as they head to the Mosque for their prayer(s). During the prayer times, no tourists are allowed to enter the Mosque.

The huge mosque has very impressive collection of calligraphy which is said to be among the best in the world. Like all Royal Ottoman mosques Bursa Ulu Camii has two minarets.The mosque is in the old center of Bursa , a good example of early Ottoman mosque typology for multiple domed plan which was abondend shorthly,  for central domed types. The centrally located mosque can be visited anytime but best avoid prayer hours starting from noon and two followed in the afternoon ( usually hours are posted outside or you may ask ) Best visit in the morning hours. Ladies are expected to cover arms and head no shorts allowed , you should take your shoes and place them on the  shelves inside, you may take pictures, no entrance fee.

Yorum: This mosque was opened for service on 1399 by the then Ottoman Sultan 1. Bayezid. Sultan Bayezid prayed to Allah and made a pledge that if he was successful at the Battle of Nicopolis he would build 20 mosques in Bursa upon his return.The Ottomans were successful at war and in spreading Islam further to areas it had never been before.  After the war the Sultan forgot about his promise to God and was reminded by the prophet in his sleep.He discussed the idea with his son in law Emir Sultan whom was a very high ranked Islamic scholar.At that time most mosques in the empire were small in size so Emir Sultan being the wise person he is suggested to his father in law sultan 1. Bayezid that instead of building 20 small sized mosques instead for him to build a mosque on a grand scale that has 20 domes.  The sultan liked this wise idea proposed by his son in law and out came the grand mosque we see and visit today.I just spent 4 days in Bursa and stayed at the Kent Hotel right across this mosque.  I performed most of my prayers at this mosque and loved it to bits.  I considered myself lucky to be able to pray in it and left Bursa a very happy person. I will be back in Bursa to visit this mosque if my life permits.

Yorum Basligi: So beautiful
Yorum: I love history and there is so much to this place. We had a very good tour guide who was very knowledgeable in the history of the mosque and its importance to Islam. The calligraphy in the building is amazing. I forgot my scarf but there were plenty available inside.

Yorum Basligi: Beautiful wall decorations.
Yorum: Ulu Camii is one of the oldest mosques in Bursa (built between 1366 and 1369). This is one of the places not to be missed in Bursa. Nothing special from outside, but hidden gem inside. I was amazed with black & white wall decorations. So different that other mosques I've seen in Turkey. That was time of prayers, so I didn't have chance to spend more time or take more pictures.

Yorum Basligi: Mesmerizing
Yorum: Ulu Camii is the biggest mosque in Turkey with a covered area of around 4000 square meters and it's definitely one of the most beautiful example of early Ottoman architecture: very simple yet imposing. It distinctively differs from many other mosques in its social gathering atmosphere: usually mosques are empty except for prayer times whereas, Ulu Camii serves as a public gathering area with families sitting around, children playing around all day long. Some of the calligraphies on the walls are chef d'oeuvres of Sultan Murat the Second. It has been a source of inspiration for many poets of Turkish literature as just we see in "Time in Bursa" poem of Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar.

Yorum: The atmosphere is great. We later realized that there was a designated entrance for women. This arrangement is good to avoid confusion with those who pray and leave at the same time. The mosque has 3 entrances.

Yorum: Peace, there is nothing else to say, the only problem is that when I performed the Friday prayer, there was no air conditioning in the mosque. The congregation, overwhelmed by sweat and heat, could not focus on the prayer, so many people were left without air. A solution is needed as soon as possible.
